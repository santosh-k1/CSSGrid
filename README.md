Safari
Webkit Meta Bug

Safari 10.1 and iOS Safari support CSS Grid as of March 27, 2017.

Microsoft Edge
On launch Edge shipped with the IE11 Grid implementation.

The updated implementation is in Edge 16 and shipped October 17th 2017.

Internet Explorer 10 and 11
The original Grid implementation was part of IE10, also in IE11. This implementation is now quite different to the current spec and other implementations. Internet Explorer 11 will never be updated to the new specification. There is some possibility in using the old spec to provide some grid layout for these browsers however.
